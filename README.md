   ```batch
	alias cd=cdv $*
  ```
   _now `cd` has all `cdv` features!_
  
  * to re-tract
  ```batch
  unalias cd
  ```

* ##### Shows help for the cdv command:
   ```batch
   cdv <optional-path>  -h
   ```
* #####  initialize new auto venv -_only used one time per project_- :
  ```batch
  cdv <optional-path>  -i
  ```

* ##### with out any parameters its just similar to `cd` until you cdv'ed to one of your projects it will auto activate the venv for you!
   ```batch
   cdv path  
   ```          
	* to activate currentt project venv
	```batch
	cdv 
	```

* ##### complete delete  for the auto venv configs and files:
   ```batch
   cdv <optional-path>  -d
   ```

* ##### to deactivate your venv .. you can also use deactivate:
  ```batch
  cdv <optional-path>  -1
  ```


> # Notesüìù:
 * #### _(in testing)_ no need to download the [installer](https://github.com/orsnaro/windows-autoenv-tool/releases/latest) for every new version _( just reinstall and it will update to latest release )_
 * #### if `<optional-path>` parameter wasn't provided will just run `cdv` command on current directory
* #### the folder which holds all venvs is defaulted to `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\py_envs`
* #### virtual environment directoroy names will be same as project name with `_env` appended to it
*  #### please dont delete `.is_autoVenv` file from your proj directory nor edit it _( unless you know what you are doing )_
*  #### command auto ignores it's `.is_autoVenv` file in `.gitignore`. _(this is only if the project is in a git repository folder)_

 ##  _for more/config your custom auto venv I recommend reading the batch script itself and raise any issuesüíô_
