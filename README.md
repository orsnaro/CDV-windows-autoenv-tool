 * #### if `<optional-path>` parameter wasn't provided will just run `cdv` command on current directory
* #### the folder which holds all venvs is defaulted to `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\py_envs`
* #### virtual environment directoroy names will be same as project name with `_env` appended to it
*  #### please dont delete `.is_autoVenv` file from your proj directory nor edit it _( unless you know what you are doing )_
*  #### command auto ignores it's `.is_autoVenv` file in `.gitignore`. _(this is only if the project is in a git repository folder)_
